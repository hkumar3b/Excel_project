   * **Technology** was the most profitable category, especially **Phones** and **Copiers**.

2. **Region-Wise Sales**:

   * The **West** region led in both sales and profitability.
   * **South** region showed moderate performance, but had high discounts affecting profit.

3. **Profitability Issues**:

   * **Tables** in the Furniture category showed high sales but very low or negative profit, indicating pricing or discount issues.

### ✅ Recommendations for the Company

* 📦 **Reevaluate Discount Strategy**: Especially for furniture and underperforming items like Tables, which are sold at high discounts but yield losses.

* 🎯 **Focus Marketing on Profitable Segments**: Invest more in Consumer and Technology segments. Increase product bundles or offers for Phones and Accessories.

* 🌍 **Target Emerging Regions**: Enhance campaigns in the **South and East** regions where there's potential to grow profitably with better margin control.

* 🪑 **Redesign or Replace Low-Performing Products**: Analyze why products like Tables result in losses—due to cost, delivery issues, or design—and take corrective action.

* 📊 **Monthly Monitoring Dashboards**: Establish monthly dashboards to monitor KPIs like profit ratio, discounts, and category-wise trends to take timely actions.
